      I miss two things more than anything else since coming to Japan: my Toyota LandCruiser 70 and my Yamaha AG100. There’s an honesty to them both; they’re indestructible, easy to maintain, and incredibly fun. The LandCruiser 70 isn’t refined or luxurious, it’s pure utility. When the pavement ends and the trail begins, that's when it comes to life. It's slow, noisy, and you feel every bump, but that’s the point. There are no complex electronics to fail, just a solid engine and a chassis built for abuse. It connects you directly to the terrain in a way modern SUVs never could.

      The Yamaha AG100 is the perfect two-wheeled counterpart. It’s light, stupidly reliable, and handles rough country like a goat. You can kickstart it in the pouring rain, ride it through deep mud, or patch it up with pliers and some wire—it just won’t complain. It's a simple machine that gives you the confidence to explore places you wouldn't dare take a bigger, heavier bike. Riding one through miles of hard terrain, with just the thrum of that little engine for company, is some of the most genuine fun I've ever had.
